# house-price-predictor
This project builds a machine learning model to predict housing prices in Boston based on key attributes such as crime rate, number of rooms, accessibility to highways, tax rates, and more. Using Linear Regression and XGBoost, it aims to provide accurate price estimations based on historical data.
